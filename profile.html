            <br>Heyo! I'm Deyan and I come from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.</br>
            <br>In short, I'm a pretty quiet guy who loves connecting with people,</br> 
            <br>and whose joy is mostly derived from supporting his fellow humans.</br> 
            <br>I also enjoy making people laugh with self-deprecating humour,</br>
            <br>mostly centered around my weight so get used to it.</br>
            <br>I'll also be competing against Michael Phelps in the 200m freestyle shortly.</br>
