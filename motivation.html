                        Motivation is the desire to act in service of a goal. It's the crucial element
                        in setting and attaining one's objectives—and research shows that people can 
                        influence their own levels of motivation and self-control.
                        Motivation can have many sources, and often people have multiple motives for 
                        engaging in any one behavior. Motivation might be extrinsic, whereby a person
                        is inspired by outside forces—other people or events that transpire. 
                        Motivation can also be intrinsic, whereby the inspiration comes from within 
                        a person—the desire to improve at a certain activity. Intrinsic motivation tends
                        to push people more forcefully, and the accomplishments are more fulfilling.

                    <h2>Dan Pink's view on motivation</h2>
                    
                    <hr class="dashcard-ind">
                    
                    <p>
                        According to Dan Pink, the evidence of scientific studies on motivation and rewards suggests
                        that, for any work task that involves most than the most basic cognitive challenge, basic
                        financial reward systems simply do not work. In fact, they can lead to worse performance.
                        For simple, straightforward tasks, Pink concedes that traditional financial rewards or a 
                        carrot & stick approach to motivation DO work. These can be considered as "external" methods
                        of motivation. They are simple and they still work.
                        He accepts that money is a motivator at work, but once people perceive that they are paid 
                        fairly, then they become much more motivated by intrinsic elements. Once people are paid fairly,
                        they look for more from their work. Dan divides intrinsic motivation into three key elements:
                        
                        <h3>Autonomy</h3>

                        Autonomy is the desire to direct our own lives. Pink argues that allowing employees autonomy runs 
                        counter to the traditional view of management which wants employees to "comply" with what is required of them.

                        <h3>Mastery</h3>

                        Pink argues that humans love to "get better at stuff" - they enjoy the satisfaction from personal achievement 
                        and progress. Allowing employees to enjoy a sense of progress at work contributes to their inner drive.
                        By contrast, a lack of opportunity at work for self-improvement or personal and professional development is 
                        liable to make employees more bored and demotivated.

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>

                        Pink describes purpose as the desire to do things in service of something larger than ourselves. Pink argues
                        that people intrinsically want to do things that matter. Most of us spend more than half our working hours at work.
                        We want that time to matter.
                        So a key part of adding purpose to work is to ensure that the mission and goals of the organisation are properly 
                        communicated to employees. Employees need to know and understand these, and appreciate how their work and role fits 
                        into what the organisation is about.
