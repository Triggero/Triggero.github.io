                        It all goes back to me approaching high school. I was in love with computers,
                        well, admittedly, the games on them, but found studying about them more in-depth really exciting.
                        I chose a high school with a profile of IT/Software Development and I was really 
                        excited to learn how to make cool games and what not. Unfortunately the programme
                        turned out to be semi-fraud since it was nothing close to a sufficient IT one.
                        The only things we learned for 4 whole school years were to convert binary into 
                        hexadecimal and how to print "Hello World" in the console using C#. I lost
                        motivation and also sucked at self-learning so I didn't go that route either.
                        But fortunately, a chunk of interest was still well in me and I decided to experiment big
                        and apply for an IT bachelor, and the ICT one at HZ seemed to fit my needs immediately.
                        So I'm here to reignite my passion and find my drive to walk this path again.
                        It's a field that can never be redundant as it always expands, and you're able to
                        be a part of that expansion. I see and feel programming as a tool to express creativity
                        and more or less, a mix of frustration when having a bug in your code, but also
                        a sense of relief and pride once you've eliminated it. Sort of like a mini version
                        of life with its issues and solutions. And to me, it's very important to have a consistent
                        flow of achievable goals, since that's really what keeps you moving, isn't it?

                    <h2>Why HBO?</h2>
                    
                    <hr class="dashcard-ind">
                    
                    <p>The moment I found out about professionally-oriented education 
                        and its differences from the standard academic approach, I realized 
                        I’d finally found my path. Why is that, you may ask? Maybe you aren’t asking,
                        but I’ll tell you anyway. I found out I was completely inept at the standard,
                        academic approach all the way back in middle school which is a fancy way of calling myself stupid. It’s crucial for me to
                        understand something I’m studying before applying it, otherwise I get lost
                        in all the information. That became very apparent in math class. The teacher
                        would present us with all these formulas and tell us which formula calculates
                        what, but we were neither taught why it does so nor did we solve problems with
                        the teacher, and that drived me nuts. I had no understanding of the topic and
                        therefore I had no motivation to keep on studying it other than the obligation
                        of me passing the school year which only made it a hassle. I still sucked at math
                        and my substantial exam, the one before high school, was coming soon. My parents
                        decided to assign me a private teacher. She would show me how everything worked,
                        why it worked, gave me examples, and solved problems with me. For only a month,
                        I made so much progress I was able to score a B on the exam, which was unimaginable for me.
                        Moral of story: I still suck at math but I at least know the efficient way I can study. That’s
                        why I chose an HBO, to work alongside the teachers, and not only know but also understand what
                        I’m dealing with, which makes studying that much more than trying to remember and then recall blank information.
